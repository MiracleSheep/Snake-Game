# Snake-Game
> This is a snake game that I coded a few months ago and decided to upload to GitHub.   
It was just an experiment to see what I could do with graphics libraries in java.   
The library used is processing.  
The code is shoddy, but it works.
It took me about three hours, and it was a great learning experience.



# How to play
* Use the WASD keys to move the snake around
* Pick up food
* Keep picking up food until the game restarts
* Very simple!


# Some game features:
* The snake will loop to the other side when you try to leave the screen
* There is a grace period where the snake will not run into their own tail unless they go the opposite direction for 35 points
